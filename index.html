    <h2>History of the Nigerian Flag</h2>
    <p>
        The Nigerian flag was designed in 1959 by Michael Taiwo Akinkunmi, a 23-year-old student studying in London.
        His design was chosen from nearly 2,000 entries in a national competition held prior to Nigeria's independence in 1960.
        The flag was first officially hoisted on October 1, 1960, when Nigeria gained its independence from Britain.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Flag Represents</h2>
    <p>
        The Nigerian flag consists of three vertical stripes of green, white, and green.
        The green stripes represent Nigeria's lush vegetation and agricultural wealth, while the white stripe symbolizes peace and unity.
